In a small village, there lived a little tortoise.
He was very slow, but he never gave up. He always kept moving forward, step by step. Other animals made fun of him — especially the rabbit.

One day, the rabbit laughed and said,

"Oh tortoise! Even a rock moves faster than you!"

The tortoise smiled and replied,

"Maybe… but I never stop."

The rabbit found it funny.
He challenged the tortoise,

"Let’s race! If you win, I’ll salute you!"

All the animals laughed, but the tortoise agreed.

The next day, the race began. The rabbit dashed forward like lightning and quickly got far ahead. He looked back and thought,

"That tortoise must still be at the starting line!"

Feeling overconfident, he lay under a tree and said,

"Let me take a little nap. Victory is mine anyway!"

But… he fell asleep.

Meanwhile, the tortoise kept walking.
Slowly. Steadily. Without stopping.

When the rabbit finally woke up —
the tortoise had already crossed the finish line.

Everyone was shocked.
The rabbit felt ashamed.
The tortoise just smiled and said:

"I may be slow, but I move a little every day — and I never stop."
